# Terraform: Azure Kubernetes

This template will create a Kubernetes environment and bootstrap it so it is ready for use.

The environment deployed contains the following resources:
> TODO: Re-assess these requirements.

Following deployment there are some additional steps that need to be performed that are specific to the application - see the Post Deployment section.

## Prerequisites

Prior to deployment you need the following:

* [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - 0.12
* [azcli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [helm](https://helm.sh/)

In Azure, you also need:
> TODO: Re-assess these requirements.
* A user account or service policy with Contributor level access to the target subscription and the Application Administrator and Group Administrator AAD roles
* If using AAD RBAC Integration, you also require a Client and Server component. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-integration-cli) for the steps
    * For viewing live data, also consult [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-livedata-setup) page

## Deployment

Below describes the steps to deploy this template.

1. Set variables for the deployment
    * Terraform has a number of ways to set variables. See [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables) for more information.
2. Log into Azure with `az login` and set your subscription with `az account set --subscription='<REPLACE_WITH_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_OR_NAME>'`
    * Terraform has a number of ways to authenticate. See [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/azure_cli.html) for more information.
3. Initialise Terraform with `terraform init`
    * By default, state is stored locally. State can be stored in different backends. See [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/index.html) for more information.
4. Set the workspace with `terraform workspace select <REPLACE_WITH_ENVIRONMENT>`
    * If the workspace does not exist, use `terraform workspace new <REPLACE_WITH_ENVIRONMENT>`
5. Generate a plan with `terraform plan -out tf.plan`
6. If the plan passes, apply it with `terraform apply tf.plan`

In the event the deployment needs to be destroyed, you can run `terraform destroy` in place of steps 5 and 6.

## Known Issues

**Provider produced inconsistent final plan on first Apply** with `azurerm_monitor_diagnostic_setting.main_aks[0]` is related to https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/6254

## Post-Deployment

### Connecting to the Cluster

> TODO: Replace these steps and also use a rolebinding to enable retrieval of configuration by the resource owner.

You can connect to your new cluster using two methods:

1. Use the Kubeconfig file created under `.terraform/.kube/clusters` directory to get immediate access
2. Run `az aks get-credentials --name <REPLACE_WITH_CLUSTER_NAME> --resource-group <REPLACE_WITH_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP>`
    * If using AAD RBAC integration you must be in one of the created AD groups to properly authenticate.

### Adding users to AD Groups

To add users to the AD groups you can either do this in-portal or through command-line. To do this with Azure CLI:

1. Get the object ID of the needed group with `terraform output aks_cluster_groups`
2. Add the user to the group with `az ad group member add --group <REPLACE_WITH_GROUP_OBJECT_ID> --member-id <REPLACE_WITH_GROUP_MEMBER_OBJECT_ID>`
    * To get the current user's object ID you can run `az ad signed-in-user show --output tsv --query objectId`

### Kubernetes Setup

Following deployment there are some resources within the cluster that need to be deployed separate to the Terraform deployment. These steps will not be tracked by Terraform itself.

Additional Kubernetes configuration files can be found under the [files/kubernetes/manifests](./files/kubernetes/manifests) directory.

#### Certificates

Certificates are handled by cert-manager to provide valid SSL certificates, which can optionally be deployed with the template. They utilise two main components: The Issuer, and the Certificate. The configuration file bases provided in this repository can be used to set up some basics.

* The Issuer can be namespaced (Issuer) or cluster-wide (ClusterIssuer)
* Certificates are namespaced
    * Certificates can support multiple names, assuming DNS is configured properly

Manifests under [files/kubernetes/manifests/cert-manager](./files/kubernetes/manifests/cert-manager) can be used as a guideline assuming DNS is set up for the endpoint.

To update the certificate you can use the following snippet to convert a certificate's Issuer

```bash
kubectl patch certificate www.example.com-cert --type=merge --patch='{"spec":{"issuerRef":{"name":"letsencrypt-prod"}}}'
```

#### Rbac Roles

Additional RBAC roles can be created for the cluster.

Manifests under [files/kubernetes/manifests/rbac](./files/kubernetes/manifests/rbac) can be used as a guideline or as-is with a cluster-admin and read-only role already in the folder.

#### Helm Charts

Additional values for some Helm charts have been stored under [files/kubernetes/helm/values](./files/kubernetes/helm/values) to provide some additional options for services to deploy to the cluster.

These charts include Cert Manager, Grafana, Prometheus and Loki

## Maintenance

As the cluster requires and has components managed by AKS, you will need to occasionally update secrets to ensure the cluster is still healthy. This can be managed with azcli.

To update the AAD Service Principal, run the following command

```bash
az aks update-credentials --name <REPLACE_WITH_CLUSTER_NAME> --resource-group <REPLACE_WITH_CLUSTER_RESOURCE_GROUP> \
    --reset-aad \
    --aad-client-app-id <REPLACE_WITH_CLUSTER_AAD_CLIENT_APP_ID> \
    --aad-server-app-id <REPLACE_WITH_CLUSTER_AAD_SERVER_APP_ID> \
    --aad-server-app-secret <REPLACE_WITH_CLUSTER_AAD_SERVER_APP_SECRET>
```
